/* ============================================
   SLIDE 05 - SOCIAL MEDIA
   Phone mockup levitation is handled in
   slider-core.js showSlide() (adds sb-loaded).
   This file is a placeholder for future
   slide-specific logic.

/* Currently no additional JS needed — levitation
   is triggered by adding .sb-loaded class in
   SBSlider.showSlide() when index === 4. */
